Pursued my bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Mumbai. After graduation, I worked at Capgemini as an Associate Consultant. I have accumulated expertise in SAP Business Warehousing, where I performed daily Data loading and Data migration. 

I decided to pursue my master's in Information Systems at Stevens Institute of Technology here in New Jersey and have grown immense interest in Python and its Application. I acquired expertise in programming foundations in Python and developed projects in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.  I freshly began learning ReactJS, Firebase, and Flask for developing Full Stack Web Applications together with Data Analytics and Visualization.

Aloof from academics, I have a piercing interest in Dance, Cooking, and Football. I performed in several dance competitions. I represented my college football team in my bachelor's.
